# Gretel AI Synthesis - Terraform and Similar implementations of Synthetic Data Transformers

### Research Goals
- Build a reliable offensive but synthetic cyber security traffic.
- Use the data and reinforcement techniques to train Defensive models.
- Design Orion Hunts, the crawler which identifies existing heuristics.
  - Evolve the system using a system based on genetic algorithms to pass the hunter's
    findings to the agents and the synthetic data builder creating a postiive reinforcement loop.
